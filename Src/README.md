Introducing the Dependency Management Package

This package is designed to offer a fundamental dependency management system. It allows you to efficiently reuse various types or objects by maintaining just one instance of each. Think of it as a simplified form of a singleton system.

In simpler terms, this package helps you manage and share important pieces of code, making your programming tasks more efficient and organized. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced coder, it's a valuable tool for enhancing your projects.
